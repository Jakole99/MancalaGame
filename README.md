# Overview
The Mancala project entails the enhancement of a Mancala game application, integrating UML design patterns for a robust architecture. 

Mancala is a traditional board game where players move stones around a board with pits, aiming to collect the most stones in their own store or home pit. The game requires strategic thinking and is known for its simple rules but complex strategies.

New variants, such as WarCali, were introduced alongside traditional Mancala and Wari, supported by a console-based UI. 


## Code Quality & Testing
We focused on code quality, leveraging tools like Visual Studio and ReSharper, and prioritized thorough testing, including unit and system tests.

Collaboration was key, with equal engagement in problem-solving and a reworked software design to reduce abstraction and duplication.
The overarching aim was to build a maintainable, scalable system that improved upon previous iterations based on user feedback.
