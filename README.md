## Overview
The Mancala project entails the enhancement of a Mancala game application, integrating UML design patterns for a robust architecture. 


New variants, such as WarCali, were introduced alongside traditional Mancala and Wari, supported by a console-based UI. 
We focused on code quality, leveraging tools like Visual Studio and ReSharper, and prioritized thorough testing, including unit and system tests. 
Collaboration was key, with equal engagement in problem-solving and a reworked software design to reduce abstraction and duplication.
The overarching aim was to build a maintainable, scalable system that improved upon previous iterations based on user feedback.
